select ?grandfather where {
	ttr:Eve dbo:parent  *** .
	***	  	     ***   ?grandfather  .
}

# B)
#
# Once you get ttr:John,
# try to write the expression in only one line using '/'
# knowing that:
#
#             ?a prop ?c .
#			  ?c prop ?d .
#
# can be simplified like this:
#
#             ?a prop / prop ?d
