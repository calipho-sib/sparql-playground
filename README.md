# Sparql Playground

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/calipho-sib/sparql-playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/calipho-sib/sparql-playground)

SPARQL playground is a standalone multi-platform web application used to learn SPARQL (implemented in Java Spring Boot and AngularJS). 

It uses Sesame 2.8.6 as SPARQL Engine. 

It is beeing developed at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isb-sib.ch/">SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics</a>.  

See the <a href="assets/poster-sparql.png" target="_blank"> poster</a> to have a quick overview of the tool.

Or see a live demo directly here: http://sparql-playground.isb-sib.ch/

You can also see a live version of nextprot samples here: http://sparql-playground.nextprot.org/


## Installation

* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/calipho-sib/sparql-playground/tarball/master)
* Unzip the folder and run the start script (start.bat for windows users or start.sh for unix users) (it requires java 1.7 or higher)
* Once the application started you should open your browser on: <a href="http://localhost:8888" target="_blank">http://localhost:8888</a>

* Select the examples and click on the GO button

## Predefined RDF scenarios / datasets

There are some scenarios predefined:

* Default scenario comes with less than 100 triplets and does not require any domain knowledge (persons and their pets), run the `start.sh` (Linux, Mac) or `start.bat` (Windows) script

* neXtProt helps you understand the neXtProt rdf model, run the `start-nextprot.sh` (Linux, Mac) or `start-nextprot.bat`  (Windows) script

* UniProt helps you understand the UniProt rdf model, run the `start-uniprot.sh` (Linux, Mac) or `start-uniprot.bat` (Windows) script

## Create your own RDF scenario (no programming skills are required) 

* You can create your own scenario by giving a directory as argument: `java -jar sparql-playgroud.war your-directory-name`


Your directory should follow this convention:

* ttl-data: a folder containing turtle file(s)
* queries: a folder containing the example queries showed in the first page 
* prefixes.ttl: a file containing the default prefixes to be added to queries
* pages: pages with markdown files for the Documentation tab

**Notes**:

* If your dataset is reasonably large that can't be fit in memory (> 50'000 triples) you may want to add the property `-Drepository.type=native`. This will create a native repository (instead of a in memory datastore). The database will be persisted in a `sesame-db` folder. The first time it will take some time to create the structure, but once the application is restarted it will be instantaneous. 

* For development purposes you may want to set the java property `-Dspring.profiles.active=nocache` so the cache is not enabled (example queries, page, images, faqs ...) 

## Technology in use

* The SPARQL engine is Sesame 2.8.6
* The backend uses Spring Boot 1.2.3
* The frontend is build with angularJS 1.3 and bootstrap 3
* Requires Java 1.7 or higher
