#Exercise 1

Build a SPARQL query to find:

* **Glycoproteins located in the cytoplasm**

## Procedure

* Select sample query 1 (NXQ_00001)

* Use the term finder to get the accession code of *glycoprotein*

* Modify the keyword term accession in the query

* Run the query
 
* Check the result you get by clicking one of the (neXtProt link) in the result:
* 
  * bottom of *Localisation* TAB should contain the term *Cytoplasm* or a more specific one (a :childOf Cytoplasm)
 
  * *Keyword* section of Sequence TAB should contain the *Glycoprotein* term

**Terms**

* Cytoplasm [cv:SL-0086], Golgi apparatus [cv:SL-0132], Phosphoprotein [cv:KW-0597], Glycoprotein [cv:KW-0325]
